jsOAuth is a Javascript implimentation of the OAuth protocol.

##Downloading jsOAuth##
It is recomended that you always try to use the latest version of jsOAuth.

There is always 2 main versions of jsOAuth, the CommonJS / Node.js module and 
the standard library. The standard library is designed to be used in application 
environments such as [Appcelerator Titanium](http://appcelerator.com).
In production environments you should use the minified version as it is smaller 
and wont bulk up your application.  
Whilst you are developing however, you may wish to use the development edition, 
this is un-compressed, un-minified and human readable, ideal for debugging when 
a something goes wrong.
